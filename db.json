These protocols are typically designed with the intention of being available to the public, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and share their code. The benefits of open-source protocols are multifaceted, ranging from their inherent transparency to their broad accessibility. Moreover, they rely on peer evaluations, which is a cost-effective and inclusive model that sets them apart from their proprietary counterparts. Prominent examples of open-source software include widely used operating systems like Linux and Android, as well as the popular Firefox web browser.
